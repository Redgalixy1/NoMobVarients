# No Mob Varients Resource Pack

The official NoMobVarients GitHub repo.


This Resource pack removes the new mob varients for the Cows, Pigs, and Chickens found in Minecraft's 1.21.5 update.

Current status:

1. Pig varients cold and warm are retextured as the regular pig texture.
2. Chicken varients cold and warm are retextured as the regular chicken texture.

Still needs work:

1. Cow varients cold and warm.


Will keep adding stuff in the future.
